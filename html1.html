        <h1>What's the difference between AR and VR</h1>
     <p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have exciting
         potential in the future of gaming, marketing, e-commerce,
          education, and many other fields. Both technologies are known
           for their enriched experience that brings together a virtual
            world and the real one with enhanced, 3-D visuals. Although
             it can be easy to mix up the two, there are some significant
              differences.</p>
              <h2>What is AR ?</h2>
              <p>Almost any person with a smartphone can get access to 
                augmented reality, making it more efficient than VR as a
                 branding and gaming tool. AR morphs the mundane, physical
                  world into a colorful, visual one by projecting virtual
                   pictures and characters through a phone's camera or
                    video viewer. Augmented reality is merely adding to the
                     user's real-life experience.</p>
                     <h2>What is VR ?</h2>
                     <p>Virtual reality takes these same components to another
                         level by producing an entirely computer-generated 
                         simulation of an alternate world. These immersive 
                         simulations can create almost any visual or place
                          imaginable for the player using special equipment
                           such as computers, sensors, headsets, and gloves.</p>
